# VS Workshop

## Intro
This repo is a simple example of a project which contains a typical set of linting, testing, bundling, and compiling tools that are important for developing front-end applications effectively. They are chosen based on my own experience and do not necessarily represent what is 'best'. The goal of this workshop is simply to introduce new students to common web technologies and coding techniques used in the industry.

*Each section contains links to the Documentation and additional resources for that topic.*

## Linting
A linter will enforce a consistent coding format across all files in a project. This is incredibly useful when a team of engineers are all making edits to the same codebase. It also will catch common bugs/syntactical mistakes that are often hard to fix.

Documentation:

- [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) (For Typescript)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

## Bundlers
Bundlers take individual files and combine them together. A couple benefits of using a bundler are:
- Coding in discrete, independent files prevents namespace collisions.
- It is easier to manage large codebases if they're broken up.
- Optimizing code for production environments.

Documentation:
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## Version Control
I would argue this is the most important item on this list. 

## Testing

## General Coding Techniques/Philosophies
